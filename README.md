A simple wildcard DNS inspired by xip.io (which seems to have been shut down now)

```bash
        10.0.0.1.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.1
    www.10.0.0.2.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.2
    foo.10.0.0.3.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.3
bar.baz.10.0.0.4.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.4
```

## How does it work?

xip.name runs a custom Domain Name Server which extracts any IP address found
in the requested domain name and sends it back in the response.

## Credits

xip.name is built on top of [Miek](http://miek.nl)’s lovely [dns package](https://github.com/miekg/dns) for Go.
